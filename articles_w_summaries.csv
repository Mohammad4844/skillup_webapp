Economic indicators are macroeconomic measurements used by analysts to comprehend current and future economic activity. Examples include the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and unemployment figures. These indicators may be leading (forecast future), lagging (confirm past trends), or coincident (reflect current state). Effective interpretation of such metrics allows for a comprehensive diagnosis of the economy's health and prediction of future market conditions, facilitating decision-making for trades, investments, and policy-making. The most common indicators are government-released data and those from non-profit organizations. While economic indicators offer significant insights, they may be inconsistent, subjective, and not always entirely accurate. The article reminds readers that the stock market, despite its predictive capacity, has limitations and risks as an indicator.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic_indicator.asp

Investing Stocks Bonds ETFs Options and Derivatives Commodities Trading FinTech and Automated Investing Brokers Fundamental Analysis Technical Analysis Markets. Economic indicators are some of the most valuable tools investors can place in their arsenals. Metrics such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and written reports like the Beige Book are free for all investors to inspect and analyze. Policymakers, most notably those at the Federal Reserve, use indicators to determine not only where the economy is going but how fast it's getting there. Most indicators provide nationwide coverage and many have detailed industry breakdowns both of which can be very useful to individual investors. Personalizing your research and knowing what the expectations are for any individual release is helpful as well as knowing the macroeconomic forecasts. Inflation Indicators and Economic Output are vital in determining prevailing interest rates and investing strategies. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the most important indicator especially to equity investors who are focused on corporate profit growth. Mark your calendar since sometimes indicators take on a more valuable role because they contain very timely data. The bottom line is that by becoming knowledgeable about the what's and why's of the major economic indicators, investors can better understand the stock market and the economy in which their dollars are invested. Using economic indicator data in conjunction with standard asset and securities analysis can lead to smarter portfolio management for both the professional asset manager and the do-it-yourself investor.""""""","The article essentially outlines the importance of economic indicators for investment decisions.

What Are Financial Markets Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where securities trading occurs including the stock market bond market forex market and derivatives market. Financial markets are vital to the smooth operation of capitalist economies. Key Takeaways Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where the trading of securities occurs. There are many kinds of financial markets including but not limited to forex money stock and bond markets. These markets may include assets or securities that are either listed on regulated exchanges or trade over-the-counter OTC. Financial markets trade in all types of securities and are critical to the smooth operation of a capitalist society. When financial markets fail economic disruption including recession and rising unemployment can result. Understanding the Financial Markets Financial markets play a vital role in facilitating the smooth operation of capitalist economies by allocating resources and creating liquidity for businesses and entrepreneurs. The markets make it easy for buyers and sellers to trade their financial holdings. Financial markets create securities products that provide a return for those with excess funds investors lenders and make these funds available to those needing additional money borrowers. The stock market is just one type of financial market. Financial markets are created when people buy and sell financial instruments including equities bonds currencies and derivatives. Financial markets rely heavily on informational transparency to ensure that the markets set prices that are efficient and appropriate. Some financial markets are small with little activity and others like the New York Stock Exchange NYSE trade trillions of dollars in securities daily. The equities stock market is a financial market that enables investors to buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. The primary stock market is where new issues of stocks are sold. Any subsequent trading of stocks occurs in the secondary market where investors buy and sell securities they already own. Prices of securities traded in the financial markets may not necessarily reflect their intrinsic value. Types of Financial Markets There are several different types of markets. Each one focuses on the types and classes of instruments available on it. Stock Markets Perhaps the most ubiquitous of financial markets are stock markets. These are venues where companies list their shares which are bought and sold by traders and investors. Stock markets or equities markets are used by companies to raise capital and by investors to search for returns. Stocks may be traded on listed exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange NYSE Nasdaq or the over-the-counter OTC market. Most stock trading is done via regulated exchanges which plays an important economic role because it is another way for money to flow through the economy. Typical participants in a stock market include both retail and institutional investors traders market makers MMs and specialists who maintain liquidity and provide two-sided markets. Brokers are third parties that facilitate trades between buyers and sellers but who do not take an actual position in a stock. Over-the-Counter Markets An over-the-counter OTC market is a decentralized market meaning it does not have physical locations and trading is conducted electronically in which market participants trade securities directly meaning without a broker. While OTC markets may handle trading in certain stocks e.g. smaller or riskier companies that do not meet the listing criteria of exchanges most stock trading is done via exchanges. Certain derivatives markets however are exclusively OTC making up an essential segment of the financial markets. Broadly speaking OTC markets and the transactions that occur in them are far less regulated less liquid and more opaque. Bond Markets A bond is a security in which an investor loans money for a defined period at a pre-established interest rate. You may think of a bond as an agreement between the lender and borrower containing the loans details and its payments. Bonds are issued by corporations as well as by municipalities states and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. For example the bond market sells securities such as notes and bills issued by the United States Treasury. The bond market is also called the debt credit or fixed-income market. Money Markets Typically the money markets trade in products with highly liquid short-term maturities less than one year and are characterized by a high degree of safety and a relatively lower interest return than other markets. At the wholesale level the money markets involve large-volume trades between institutions and traders. At the retail level they include money market mutual funds bought by individual investors and money market accounts opened by bank customers. Individuals may also invest in the money markets by purchasing short-term certificates of deposit CDs municipal notes or U.S. Treasury bills among other examples. Derivatives Markets A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset like a security or set of assets like an index. Rather than trading stocks directly a derivatives market trades in futures and options contracts and other advanced financial products that derive their value from underlying instruments like bonds commodities currencies interest rates market indexes and stocks. Futures markets are where futures contracts are listed and traded. Unlike forwards which trade OTC futures markets utilize standardized contract specifications are well-regulated and use clearinghouses to settle and confirm trades. Options markets such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Cboe similarly list and regulate options contracts. Both futures and options exchanges may list contracts on various asset classes such as equities fixed-income securities commodities and so on. Forex Market The forex foreign exchange market is where participants can buy sell hedge and speculate on the exchange rates between currency pairs. The forex market is the most liquid market in the world as cash is the most liquid of assets. The currency market handles more than 7.5 trillion in daily transactions more than the futures and equity markets combined. As with the OTC markets the forex market is also decentralized and consists of a global network of computers and brokers worldwide. The forex market is made up of banks commercial companies central banks investment management firms hedge funds and retail forex brokers and investors. Commodities Markets Commodities markets are venues where producers and consumers meet to exchange physical commodities such as agricultural products e.g. corn livestock soybeans energy products oil gas carbon credits precious metals gold silver platinum or soft commodities such as cotton coffee and sugar. These are known as spot commodity markets where physical goods are exchanged for money. However the bulk of trading in these commodities takes place on derivatives markets that utilize spot commodities as the underlying assets. Forwards futures and options on commodities are exchanged both OTC and on listed exchanges around the world such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME and the Intercontinental Exchange ICE. Cryptocurrency Markets Thousands of cryptocurrency tokens are available and traded globally across a patchwork of independent online crypto exchanges. These exchanges host digital wallets for traders to swap one cryptocurrency for another or for fiat monies such as dollars or euros. Because most crypto exchanges are centralized platforms users are susceptible to hacks or fraudulent activity. Decentralized exchanges are also available that operate without any central authority. These exchanges allow direct peer-to-peer P2P trading without an actual exchange authority to facilitate the transactions. Futures and options trading are also available on major cryptocurrencies. Examples of Financial Markets The above sections make clear that the financial markets are broad in scope and scale. To give two more concrete examples we will consider the role of stock markets in bringing a company to IPO and the role of the OTC derivatives market in the 2008-09 financial crisis. Stock Markets and IPOs As a company establishes itself over time and grows it needs access to additional capital. It will often find itself in need of much larger amounts of capital than it can get from ongoing operations traditional bank loans or venture and angel funding. Firms can raise the amount of capital they need by selling shares of itself to the public through an initial public offering IPO. This changes the companys status from a private firm whose shares are held by a few shareholders to a publicly traded company whose shares will be subsequently held by public investors. The IPO also offers early investors in the company an opportunity to cash out part of their stake often reaping very handsome rewards in the process. Initially the underwriters usually set the IPO price through their pre-marketing process. Once the companys shares are listed on a stock exchange and trading commences the price of these shares will fluctuate as investors and traders assess and reassess their intrinsic value and the supply and demand for those shares at any given moment. OTC Derivatives and the 2008 Financial Crisis MBS and CDOs While the 2008-09 financial crisis was caused and made worse by several factors one factor that has been widely identified is the market for mortgage-backed securities MBS. These are OTC derivatives where cash flows from individual mortgages are bundled sliced up and sold to investors. The crisis resulted from a sequence of events each with its own trigger these events culminated in the banking systems near-collapse. It has been argued that the seeds of the crisis were sown as far back as the 1970s with the Community Development Act which required banks to loosen their credit requirements for lower-income consumers creating a market for subprime mortgages. The amount of subprime mortgage debt guaranteed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae continued to expand into the early 2000s when the Federal Reserve Board began to cut interest rates drastically to avoid a recession. The combination of loose credit requirements and cheap money spurred a housing boom which drove speculation pushing up housing prices and creating a real estate bubble. In the meantime the investment banks looking for easy profits in the wake of the dotcom bust and the 2001 recession created a type of MBS called collateralized debt obligations CDOs from the mortgages purchased on the secondary market. Because subprime mortgages were bundled with prime mortgages there was no way for investors to understand the risks associated with the product. When the market for CDOs began to heat up the housing bubble that had been building for several years finally burst. As housing prices fell subprime borrowers began to default on loans that were worth more than their homes accelerating the decline in prices. When investors realized the MBS and CDOs were worthless due to the toxic debt they represented they attempted to unload the obligations. However there was no market for the CDOs. The subsequent cascade of subprime lender failures created liquidity contagion that reached the upper tiers of the banking system. Two major investment banks Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns collapsed under the weight of their exposure to subprime debt and more than 450 banks failed over the next five years. Several major banks were on the brink of failure and were rescued by a tax-payer funded bailout. The Bottom Line Financial markets provide liquidity capital and participation that are essential for economic growth and stability. Without financial markets capital could not be allocated efficiently and economic activity such as commerce and trade investments and growth opportunities would be greatly diminished. Many players make markets an essential part of the economy firms use stock and bond markets to raise capital from investors. Speculators look to various asset classes to make directional bets on future prices. At the same time hedgers use derivatives markets to mitigate various risks and arbitrageurs seek to take advantage of mispricings or anomalies observed across various markets. Brokers often act as mediators that bring buyers and sellers together earning a commission or fee for their services.""""""","The text provides a comprehensive overview of various facets of financial markets, laying out their crucial role in facilitating economic transactions and shaping the capitalist economy.

5,5,5,"""The 50-30-20 Budget Rule Explained With Examples. The rule is to split your after-tax income into three categories of spending: 50 on needs, 30 on wants, and 20 on savings. This intuitive and straightforward rule can help you draw up a reasonable budget that you can stick to over time in order to meet your financial goals. The rule states that you should spend up to 50 of your after-tax income on needs and obligations that you must-have or must-do. The remaining half should be split up between 20 savings and debt repayment and 30 to everything else that you might want. The rule is a template that is intended to help individuals manage their money and save for emergencies and retirement. The purpose of the 50-30-20 rule is to balance paying for necessities while being mindful of long-term savings and retirement. The 50-30-20 rule can be simplified by setting up automatic deposits using automatic payments and tracking changes in income.

The 50-30-20 rule is intended to help individuals manage their after-tax income, primarily to have funds on hand for emergencies and savings for retirement. Every household should prioritize creating an emergency fund in case of job losses, unexpected medical expenses or any other unforeseen monetary cost. If an emergency fund is used, then a household should focus on replenishing it. Saving for retirement is also a critical step as individuals are living longer. Calculating how much you will need for retirement and working towards that goal beginning at a young age will ensure a comfortable retirement.

The idea behind the 50-30-20 rule is that anyone can use these proportions regardless of their income. However, be mindful how those with lower income or those living in higher cost of living areas may need to adjust these percentages.

Saving is difficult and life often throws unexpected expenses at us. By following the 50-20-30 rule, individuals have a plan with how they should manage their after-tax income. If they find that their expenditures on wants are more than 30, they can find ways to reduce those expenses that will help direct funds to more important areas such as emergency money and retirement. Life should be enjoyed and it is not recommended to live like a Spartan but having a plan and sticking to it will allow you to cover your expenses, save for retirement all at the same time doing the activities that make you happy.""","The article centers around the 50-30-20 budget rule, a financial tool designed to help individuals manage their after-tax income wisely. According to the rule, 50% of income should be allocated to essential needs and obligations, 30% should be directed towards personal wants, and the remaining 20% should be put into savings and debt repayment. This method presents a balanced approach towards satisfying immediate necessities, indulging personal wishes, and preparing for the future by focusing on emergency funds and retirement savings. The universality of the concept can work with any income level, although adjustments may be necessary for those with lower income or those residing in areas with a high cost of living. Despite life's unpredictability and the challenges of saving, adhering to the 50-20-30 rule can provide a feasible financial plan that allows for enjoyment while ensuring fiscal responsibility.",https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022916/what-502030-budget-rule.asp

What Is an Emergency Fund? Understanding Emergency Funds How to Build an Emergency Fund Helping Employees Save Example of an Emergency Fund. How much should I have in an emergency fund? How can I create an emergency fund if I am living paycheck to paycheck? What is an emergency fund for? 

Budgeting Savings Emergency Fund By Daniel Kurt and Marguerita Cheng. 

The term ""emergency fund"" refers to money stashed away that people can use in times of financial distress. The purpose of an emergency fund is to improve financial security by creating a safety net that can be used to meet unanticipated expenses such as an illness or major home repairs. Assets in an emergency fund tend to be cash or other highly liquid assets. This reduces the need to either draw from high-interest debt options such as credit cards or unsecured loans, or undermine your future security by tapping into retirement funds.

Emergency funds should typically have three to six months worth of expenses, although the 2020 economic crisis and lockdown has led some experts to suggest up to one year's worth. Individuals should keep their emergency funds in accounts that are easily accessible and easily liquidated. Savers can use tax refunds and other windfalls to build up their funds. Some employers have established programs to encourage emergency fund saving.

You establish an emergency fund when you put away money that is intended to be used during times of financial hardship. This includes the loss of your job, a debilitating illness, or a major repair to your home or car, not to mention the kind of major economic crisis and lockdown that happened in 2020. Many financial advisors recommend saving enough to cover anywhere from three to six months worth of expenses, which can help you weather a modest healthcare bill or a short bout of unemployment. 

For example, a single adult without children may be content covering three months of expenses, while the sole breadwinner for an entire family may want to have enough to cover half a year or more. Research shows that many Americans are well short of the recommended range. In fact, a 2020 survey by the Federal Reserve found that more than one-fourth of Americans lacked the ability to cover a $400 expense with cash or its equivalents. Among unemployed workers, that figure rose to 45%.

Starting early is the key to setting up an emergency fund because it helps you build up a comfortable cushion against unexpected emergencies later in life. Getting a start on emergency funds is relatively easy. Here are two simple ways to begin saving for one:

1. Set aside a comfortable amount from your salary each month. Calculate your living expenses for the desired period and make that your target for an emergency fund. You can then divert a portion of your paycheck, perhaps by setting up an automatic transfer to that account each month. Once the fund is built up, invest extra savings for the long term or other goals such as the down payment on a mortgage. Once you've maxed out your retirement savings, that money could go into an investment account with higher risks and rewards.
2. Save your tax refund. You may be tempted to think of a tax refund or stimulus check as extra money for discretionary spending. Instead, consider diverting it toward your emergency fund to give you an added financial cushion.

You probably want to park your emergency fund in a vehicle that can be easily liquidated should a financial need suddenly arise. While storing cash in a savings account may be the safest approach, there are other relatively secure ways to store a part of your emergency fund that offer greater interest-earning potential. These include high-interest savings accounts, money market accounts, and no-penalty certificates of deposit CDs which don't charge savers a fee if they need to pull their money out before the maturity date.

An emergency fund protects your portfolio against that risk.""""""
","The article discusses the importance of having an emergency fund and provides advice on how to establish one. An emergency fund serves as a financial buffer during unforeseen scenarios such as job loss, health troubles, or significant home or car repair costs. Keeping this fund in cash or easily liquid assets helps to avoid resorting to high-interest debt options or damaging one's future security by draining retirement funds. It's recommended to save three to six months' worth of expenses in an emergency fund. However, due to the 2020 economic crisis, some experts suggest saving up to a year's worth. Unfortunately, many Americans lack adequate emergency savings, with over a quarter unable to cover an abrupt $400 expense with cash or equivalents, according to a Federal Reserve survey. The article suggests starting early to build an emergency fund, making regular automatic transfers from your paycheck, or using tax refunds or other financial windfalls. The emergency fund should be easily accessible and liquidated with options including high-interest savings accounts, money market accounts, or no-penalty certificates of deposit (CDs). An emergency fund serves to mitigate financial risks.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergency_fund.asp

By setting aside some of your money now in investments that could appreciate over time, you'll set yourself up for greater financial security in the future. Now that you've decided that you want to invest, it's important to devote some time to learning how to invest. With that in mind, here are some basic concepts you should know before you get started.

The basic types of investments that include Stocks, Bonds, Cash, Mutual funds and ETFs. Determining the appropriate asset allocation for your investment strategy is a critical step to take. There are two main methods of investing, Active and Passive investing. The question you need to answer is how much time you want to spend on investing. If you have the time and desire to research individual stocks, active investment could be the way to go. If not, there's nothing wrong with passive investing.

If you choose to invest in individual stocks, the first thing you should understand is the difference between investing and speculating. Investing is a long-term activity designed to achieve sustained returns that can compound over time. Speculating is akin to gambling -- trying to chase a quick payday. With that in mind, there are certain types of stocks that make excellent long-term investments especially for beginners.

Once you've learned the basics and you've come up with your game plan, then the next step is to open a brokerage account and put your plan into action. Be sure to shop around as different brokerages charge different fees and offer different features.

Even conservative insured investments such as certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by a bank or credit union come with inflation risk. That is, they may not earn enough over time to keep pace with the increasing cost of living. 

What Is Risk When you invest, you make choices about what to do with your financial assets. Risk is any uncertainty with respect to your investments that has the potential to negatively impact your financial welfare. 

Risk and Reward The level of risk associated with a particular investment or asset class typically correlates with the level of return the investment might achieve. The rationale behind this relationship is that investors willing to take on risky investments and potentially lose money should be rewarded for their risk. 

Time Can Be Your Friend or Foe Based on historical data, holding a broad portfolio of stocks over an extended period of time significantly reduces your chances of losing your principal. However, the historical data should not mislead investors into thinking that there is no risk in investing in stocks over a long period of time. 

Managing Risk You cannot eliminate investment risk. But two basic investment strategies, asset allocation and diversification, can help manage both systemic risk (risk affecting the economy as a whole) and non-systemic risk (risks that affect a small part of the economy or even a single company). Hedging (buying a security to offset a potential loss on another investment) and insurance products can provide additional ways to manage risk. 

The bottom line is that all investments carry some degree of risk. By better understanding the nature of risk and taking steps to manage those risks, you put yourself in a better position to meet your financial goals.""""""","This article discusses the nature of risk in various types of investments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and even insured options like certificates of deposit (CDs).

Roth vs. traditional IRAs. IRA Roth Conversion: How to convert to a Roth IRA online. If your employer offers a retirement plan like a 401k or 403b and will match a percentage of your contributions, you should definitely take advantage of it. It's free money for you. Plus, you'll have a tax-deferred account that makes saving a cinch through automatic payroll deduction. If your employer doesn't offer a plan, then an IRA can be a good start to your retirement savings and another opportunity for your earnings to grow tax-free. 

Facts & figures you need to know, 401k & IRA: 

Who can participate: Anyone who works for an employer that offers a plan. Effective for 2020 contributions and later, anyone with earned income can open and contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. 

How much you can invest: If you're under age 50, your annual contribution limit is 20500 for 2022 and 22500 for 2023. If you're under age 50, your annual contribution limit is 6000 for 2022 and 6500 for 2023. 

What you can invest in: Most employers limit you to a preselected list of investment choices. You can invest in a wide variety of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and individual stocks and bonds. 

How to get started: Your employer may automatically enroll you in the plan and offer you an easy way to contribute through automatic payroll deduction. You can open an IRA on your own through almost any bank, brokerage company, insurance firm, or investment company. 

If you're eligible to invest in a 401k and an IRA, here's an efficient way to do it: Enroll in your company's 401k and contribute at least the amount that your employer will match. Contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA. Go back to your 401k plan and contribute beyond the match to the annual maximum allowed if possible. 

We recommend following these steps because an IRA offers more flexibility and choice, giving you a greater chance to diversify your assets and reduce your investment risk. 

Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. When taking withdrawals from an IRA before age 59, you may have to pay ordinary income tax plus a 10% federal penalty tax.""","The article provides a detailed comparison and advice on using 401k and IRA (Individual Retirement Accounts) for retirement savings.

The article continues by explaining the intricacies of 401k and IRA's eligibility, investment potential, and contribution limits. It encourages the reader to first contribute up to the employer's match in a 401k, then to the maximum allowable in an IRA, followed by further 401k contributions, if possible.

15,15,15,"""""""Market Structure - Overview, Definition, Features, and Types. Market structure in economics refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for goods and services. It is based on the characteristics that influence the behavior and outcomes of companies working in a specific market. Some of the factors that determine a market structure include the number of buyers and sellers, ability to negotiate, degree of concentration, degree of differentiation of products, and the ease or difficulty of entering and exiting the market.

Summary: 
Market structure refers to how different industries are classified and differentiated based on their degree and nature of competition for services and goods.
The four popular types of market structures include perfect competition, oligopoly market, monopoly market, and monopolistic competition.
Market structures show the relations between sellers and other sellers, sellers to buyers, or more.

Understanding Market Structures:
In economics, market structures can be understood well by closely examining an array of factors or features exhibited by different players. It is common to differentiate these markets across the following seven distinct features:
- The industry's buyer structure
- The turnover of customers
- The extent of product differentiation
- The nature of costs of inputs
- The number of players in the market
- Vertical integration extent in the same industry
- The largest player's market share

Types of Market Structures:
1. Perfect Competition
Perfect competition occurs when there is a large number of small companies competing against each other. They sell similar products, lack price influence over the commodities, and are free to enter or exit the market. Consumers in this type of market have full knowledge of the goods being sold. They are aware of the prices charged on them and the product branding.

2. Monopolistic Competition
Monopolistic competition refers to an imperfectly competitive market with traits of both the monopoly and competitive market. Sellers compete among themselves and can differentiate their goods in terms of quality and branding to look different.

3. Oligopoly
An oligopoly market consists of a small number of large companies that sell differentiated or identical products. Since there are few players in the market, their competitive strategies are dependent on each other.

4. Monopoly
In a monopoly market, a single company represents the whole industry. It has no competitor and it is the sole seller of products in the entire market.

The Optimal Capital Structure denotes a company's balance of debt, equity, and other financial instruments that ideally delivers the lowest cost of capital while maximizing shareholder value. This is also defined in the calculation of the firm’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). With reference to a company's investments, if the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is lower than WACC, it suggests that the investment isn't generating sufficient returns. In such cases, the author recommends repurchasing shares or paying cash dividends. However, when IRR is greater than WACC, it implies promising returns, suggesting reinvestment for better outcomes. The article emphasizes that an optimal capital structure requires a careful balance between debt and equity. Excess debt may lead to potential default in repayment, while over-reliance on equity might dilute value for investors. Additional factors shaping the optimal capital structure include cost of capital, risk tolerance, industry and business characteristics, flexibility and growth, market conditions, and debt covenants and restrictions.",https://medium.com/@dorothymacasasa/corporate-finance-fundamentals-optimal-capital-structure-f77ee6cc23f3

However these prices will be dependent on the quantity they desire to produce. Since there are many producers this will not affect the market as a whole. A company will use branding advertising and packaging to sell seemingly different products. Consequently there exist many prices in the market due to differentiated products. Also since there are many competitors a firm wont be affected by another firm's strategy. As a result companies will have control over their own prices. Oligopolistic Competition Market Pricing Strategy Here prices are determined by competitors. Firms in this market structure are highly dependent on one another when setting prices. With only a few sellers in an oligopoly a company can affect the market prices but cannot control the whole market. As a result competition is based on product differentiation and services but not on price wars. Generally an optimal pricing strategy in the long run incorporates the reactions of rival firms to changes in prices effected by competitors. Monopoly Market Structure The pricing strategy here is relatively simple. A monopoly can comfortably set prices due to the absence of competitors. However monopolists are careful not to set their prices too high and consequently attract competitors or excite a change of consumer behavior or consumption habits if you may in favor of substitute products. Besides raising prices may also lead to a fall in sales since prices depend on demand. Question In monopolistic competitive markets firms A. are price takers B. react to the prices set by competitors or C. set their own prices. Solution The correct answer is C. In monopolistic competition a firm wont be affected by another firms strategy. Companies will have control over their own prices and use branding advertising and packaging to differentiate themselves.""","The article examines pricing strategy within different market structures. In a perfectly competitive market, prices are determined by demand and supply curves, with firms operating until production costs fall below revenue. In a monopolistic competitive market, companies set their own prices and sell seemingly different products through branding, advertising, and packaging strategies. Oligopolistic competition involves prices determined by a limited number of competitors, with a focus on product differentiation and service instead of price wars. In a monopoly market, a single entity controls pricing; however, care must be taken not to drive consumers to substitute products by charging excessively high prices.",https://analystprep.com/cfa-level-1-exam/economics/describe-pricing-strategy-under-each-market-structure/

Learn about our editorial policies Knowing how to work with the numbers in a company's financial statements is an essential skill for stock investors. The meaningful interpretation and analysis of balance sheets income statements and cash flow statements to discern a company's investment qualities is the basis for smart investment choices. However the diversity of financial reporting requires that we first become familiar with certain financial statement characteristics before focusing on individual corporate financials. In this article we'll show you what the financial statements have to offer and how to use them to your advantage. Key Takeaways Understanding how to read a company's financial statements is a key skill for any investor wanting to make smart investment choices. There are four sections to a company's financial statements the balance sheet the income statement the cash flow statement and the explanatory notes. Prudent investors might also want to review a company's 10-K which is the detailed financial report the company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. An investor should also review non-financial information that could impact a company's return such as the state of the economy the quality of the company's management and the company's competitors. 1. Financial Statement Scorecard There are millions of individual investors worldwide and while a large percentage of these investors have chosen mutual funds as the vehicle of choice for their investing activities many others are also investing directly in stocks. Prudent investing practices dictate that we seek out quality companies with strong balance sheets solid earnings and positive cash flows. Whether you're a do-it-yourself investor or rely on guidance from an investment professional learning certain fundamental financial statement analysis skills can be very useful. Almost 30 years ago businessman Robert Follett wrote a book entitled How To Keep Score In Business. His principal point was that in business you keep score with dollars and the scorecard is a financial statement. He recognized that a lot of people don't understand keeping score in business. They get mixed up about profits assets cash flow and return on investment. The same thing could be said today about a large portion of the investing public especially when it comes to identifying investment values in financial statements. But don't let this intimidate you it can be done. 2. Financial Statements to Use The financial statements used in investment analysis are the balance sheet the income statement and the cash flow statement with additional analysis of a company's shareholders' equity and retained earnings. Although the income statement and the balance sheet typically receive the majority of the attention from investors and analysts it's important to include in your analysis the often overlooked cash flow statement. 3. What's Behind the Numbers The numbers in a company's financial statements reflect the company's business products services and macro-fundamental events. These numbers and the financial ratios or indicators derived from them are easier to understand if you can visualize the underlying realities of the fundamentals driving the quantitative information. For example before you start crunching numbers it's critical to develop an understanding of what the company does its products and or services and the industry in which it operates. 4. Diversity of Reporting Don't expect financial statements to fit into a single mold. Many articles and books on financial statement analysis take a one-size-fits-all approach. Less-experienced investors might get lost when they encounter a presentation of accounts that falls outside the mainstream of a so-called typical company. Please remember that the diverse nature of business activities results in a diverse set of financial statement presentations. This is particularly true of the balance sheet the income statement and cash flow statement are less susceptible to this phenomenon. 5. Understanding Financial Jargon The lack of any appreciable standardization of financial reporting terminology complicates the understanding of many financial statement account entries. This circumstance can be confusing for the beginning investor. There's little hope that things will change on this issue in the foreseeable future but a good financial dictionary can help considerably. Investopedia's Glossary of Terms provides you with thousands of definitions and detailed explanations to help you understand terms related to finance investing and economics. 6. Accounting Art Not Science The presentation of a company's financial position as portrayed in its financial statements is influenced by management's estimates and judgments. In the best of circumstances management is scrupulously honest and candid while the outside auditors are demanding strict and uncompromising. Whatever the case the imprecision that can be inherently found in the accounting process means that the prudent investor should take an inquiring and skeptical approach to financial statement analysis. 7. Key Accounting Conventions Generally accepted accounting principles GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS are used to prepare financial statements. Both methods are legal in the United States although GAAP is most commonly used. The main difference between the two methods is that GAAP is more rules-based while IFRS is more principles-based. Both have different ways of reporting asset values depreciation and inventory to name a few. 8. Non-Financial Information Information on the state of the economy the industry competitive considerations market forces technological change the quality of management and the workforce are not directly reflected in a company's financial statements. Investors need to recognize that financial statement insights are but one piece albeit an important one of the larger investment puzzle. 9. Financial Ratios and Indicators The absolute numbers in financial statements are of little value for investment analysis unless these numbers are transformed into meaningful relationships to judge a company's financial performance and gauge its financial health. The resulting ratios and indicators must be viewed over extended periods to spot trends. Please beware that evaluative financial metrics can differ significantly by industry company size and stage of development. 10. Notes to Financial Statements The financial statement numbers don't provide all of the disclosure required by regulatory authorities. Analysts and investors alike universally agree that a thorough understanding of the notes to financial statements is essential to properly evaluate a company's financial condition and performance. As noted by auditors on financial statements the accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements. Please include a thorough review of the noted comments in your investment analysis. 11. The Annual Report 10-K Prudent investors should only consider investing in companies with audited financial statements which are a requirement for all publicly-traded companies. Perhaps even before digging into a company's financials an investor should look at the company's annual report and the 10-K. Much of the annual report is based on the 10-K but contains less information and is presented in a marketable document intended for an audience of shareholders. The 10-K is reported directly to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC and tends to contain more details than other reports. Included in the annual report is the auditors' report which gives an auditors opinion on how the accounting principles have been applied. A clean opinion provides you with a green light to proceed. Qualifying remarks may be benign or serious in the case of the latter you may not want to proceed. 12. Consolidated Statements Typically the word consolidated appears in the title of a financial statement as in a consolidated balance sheet. A consolidation of a parent company and its majority-owned more than 50% ownership or effective control subsidiaries means that the combined activities of separate legal entities are expressed as one economic unit. The presumption is that consolidation as one entity is more meaningful than separate statements for different entities. Why are Financial Statements Important Financial statements provide investors with information about a company's financial position helping to ensure corporate transparency and accountability. Understanding how to interpret key financial reports such as a balance sheet and cash flow statement helps investors assess a company's financial health before making an investment. Investors can also use information disclosed in the financial statements to calculate ratios for making comparisons against previous periods and competitors. What Key Financial Statements Should I Understand When Analyzing a Company Investors should start by learning how to interpret key figures on a company's balance sheet income statement and statement of cash flows. Those wanting to dig a little deeper may want to consider learning how to analyze reports such as shareholders' equity and retained earnings. Investors can find a publicly traded company's financial statements in its annual report or a 10-K filed with the SEC. What's the Difference Between GAAP and IFRS Accounting Conventions GAAP sets accounting guidelines and standards that companies must follow when preparing financial statements whereas IFRS takes a more principles-based approach. Both conventions differ in how they report asset values depreciation and inventory. GAAP typically requires more disclosures than IFRS with the latter providing much less overall detail. Both accounting methods are legal in the United States. What are Some Key Limitations of Using Financial Statements Financial statements only provide a snapshot of a company's financial situation at a specific point in time. They also don't consider non-financial information such as the health of the broader economy and other factors such as income inequality or environmental sustainability. Forward-looking financial statements rely on estimates and assumptions which may not always be accurate and are subject to change. The Bottom Line Understanding the basics of financial statements provides investors with valuable information about a company's financial health. Investors can use key reports such as a balance sheet cash flow statement and income statement to evaluate a company's performance helping to make more informed investment decisions. However it's also important to understand the limitations of overly relying on financial statements and consider other metrics such as the impact of non-financial information when analyzing a company's overall financial position. Financial statements play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the financial system and promoting trust between companies and investors.

23,23,23,"""Net present value definition. Accounting Tools. What is Net Present Value? Net present value is an analysis tool used to decide whether to invest in a capital asset. It is employed as part of the capital budgeting process. A desirable investment is one that yields a positive net present value which implies that a business will receive excess cash over time as a result of the investment. A negative net present value indicates that a company will lose money on a proposed investment. A negative net present value is usually grounds to terminate an investment that is under consideration.

How to Calculate Net Present Value? Net present value is calculated as the difference between the present value of one or more inbound cash flows and one or more outbound cash flows. The discounted cash flow methodology is used to derive present value using a discount rate as the basis for the discounting. The discount rate is typically based on the cost of capital of the business running the analysis. If the cash flows associated with a proposed investment are expected to be unusually risky then the discount rate may be increased thereby reducing the net present value of the associated cash flows.

Advantages of Net Present Value: A key benefit of net present value is that it reduces the cash flows associated with a project to one numeric value which can be easily compared to the net present values of other projects. The project generating the highest net present value is then selected for investment while the other projects are assigned a lower priority or rejected.

Disadvantages of Net Present Value: Net present value is not a perfect analysis tool for it suffers from several problems. First, estimated cash flows rarely match actual results especially when the original estimates are excessively optimistic. Second, the discount rate used for a capital asset analysis may not be appropriate given the incremental cost of the capital required to fund a project. Third, an adjustment of the discount rate to account for risk is usually a guess; there is no quantitative derivation of the adjustment. And finally, an investment based on a net present value analysis only looks at the circumstances of a specific investment rather than the entire system of profit generation, thus investments using NPV can be sub-optimized.""","The article discusses the concept of Net Present Value (NPV), an analytical tool used in deciding whether to invest in a capital asset. A positive NPV suggests that a business will make a profit over time from an investment, whereas a negative NVP typically results in the investment being rejected. To calculate NPV, the difference between present value of inbound and outbound cash flows is assessed, using a discount rate based on the cost of capital. Risks associated with the investment may lead to an increased discount rate, hence a lower NPV. The advantage of NPV is its simplification of cash flows into a single value, which allows easy comparison between projects. However, the shortcomings include disparities between estimated and actual cash flows, potential inadequacy of the discount rate, subjectivity in risk adjustment, and a narrow focus on a specific investment, potentially leading to sub-optimal choices.",https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/net-present-value
24,24,24,"""5 Methods for Capital Budgeting Capital budgeting is defined as the process used to determine whether capital assets are worth investing in. Capital assets are generally only a small portion of a company's total assets, but they are usually long-term investments like new equipment, facilities, and software upgrades. By incorporating strategically planned capital budgeting into their financial processes, companies can more effectively determine and prioritize which projects, programs, and other investment assets could be most financially beneficial in the long-term. 

There are five primary methods of capital budgeting:

1. Internal Rate of Return: This calculation is used to determine whether a particular investment is worthwhile by assessing the interest that should be yielded over the course of a capital investment. 

2. Net Present Value: Represents the difference between the current value of money flowing into the project and the current value of money being spent.

3. Profitability Index: Identifies the relationship between the cost of a proposed investment and the benefits that could be produced if the venture was successful.

4. Accounting Rate of Return: It's the projected return that an organization can expect from a proposed capital investment.

5. Payback Period: Financial analytical tool that defines the length of time necessary to earn back money that has been invested.
  
All the methods have their pros and cons and their utility depends on specific financial and strategic situations. It is important that practicing finance professionals develop an understanding of these methods and how they can be utilized to decide the best course of action when firms are planning their next significant capital investment.""

It is a vital tool essential for a business to succeed, whether it is a startup or a Fortune 500 company. A financial modeling course on Udemy can familiarize you with the concepts and strategies vital to business success. 

Research analysts, investment bankers, accountants, and entrepreneurs use financial modeling to better understand a company's performance before making important business decisions. Financial models are generated using MS Excel and can help you accomplish a variety of important tasks such as forecasting business performance, budgeting, asset management, and understanding cash flow. Financial modeling requires a keen sense of numbers and data to prepare the best financial reports for yourself or your clients.

There are several different types of financial models used by professionals to help them make the best business decisions. Financial models help professionals make important business decisions about raising capital, forecasting business changes and requirements, or what it will take to grow a business. Some examples of these useful financial models are the discounted cash flow (DCF), a valuation method used to determine the worth of investing in a business; leveraged buyout (LBO), which examines the impact of funding an acquisition with debt; and mergers and acquisitions (M&A), a method that analyzes the result of acquiring or merging with another company.

Investment bankers assist corporations and individual investors by making a variety of critical decisions to best ensure the success of their business and financial growth. They work in four areas of the financial services industry: capital markets, advisory, trading and brokerage, and asset management. Investment bankers usually work for investment banks that serve business clients. They are not like traditional commercial banks that members of the public use to handle their checking and savings accounts. They provide guidance and expertise to corporate clients seeking to issue an IPO (initial public offering) to raise capital that they could use to expand a business, acquire or merge with another company.

Balance sheets, income statements, and the statement of cash flows are essential documents in financial modeling. Balance sheets outline what the business owns or its assets. It also notes what the business owes or its debt and liabilities. An income statement shows how much profit a company generated during a particular year. The statement of cash flows provides insight into how effectively the organization manages its operations and is used to assess a company's ability to generate cash from operations, financing, and investing.""""""","The article discusses the importance and application of financial modeling in business.

Investing Stocks Bonds ETFs Options and Derivatives Commodities Trading FinTech and Automated Investing Brokers Fundamental Analysis Technical Analysis Markets View All. Risk management involves identifying, analyzing, and accepting or mitigating uncertainty in investment decisions. It is the process of monitoring and dealing with the financial risks associated with investing. It occurs when an investor or fund manager analyzes and attempts to quantify the potential for losses in an investment such as a moral hazard and then takes the appropriate action or inaction to meet their objectives and risk tolerance.

Risk is inseparable from return in the investment world. A solid understanding of risk in its different forms can help investors to better understand the opportunities, trade-offs, and costs involved with different investment approaches. It can come close to zero for U.S. T-bills or very high for emerging-market equities or real estate in highly inflationary markets. Risk is quantified in absolute and in relative terms. Strategies include avoidance, retention, sharing, transferring, and loss prevention and reduction. One of the tactics to ascertain risk is standard deviation, which is a statistical measure of dispersion around a central tendency.

A sector or country selection, fundamental analysis, and technical analysis are among the factors unrelated to market risk. In their quest for excess returns, active managers expose investors to alpha risk. For instance, a fund manager may think that the energy sector will outperform the S&P 500 and increase her portfolio's weighting in this sector. If unexpected economic developments cause energy stocks to decline sharply, the manager will likely underperform the benchmark.

The pricing difference between passive beta risk and active strategies alpha risk encourages many investors to try and separate these risks, paying lower fees for the beta risk assumed and concentrating costly exposures to specifically defined alpha opportunities. This is popularly known as portable alpha, the idea that the alpha component of a total return is separate from the beta component.

Risk management is a key part of the investment and financial world. It requires investors and fund managers to identify, analyze, and make important decisions about the uncertainty that comes with reaching their goals. It allows individuals to reach their goals while mitigating or dealing with any of the associated losses.

Beta and Passive risk measure is oriented to behavioral tendencies and refers to any period during which an asset's return is negative, relative to a previous high mark. In measuring drawdown, we attempt to address the magnitude of each negative period - how bad, the duration of each - how long, and the frequency - how often. For example, in addition to wanting to know whether a mutual fund beat the S&P 500, we also want to know its comparative risk. A beta greater than 1 indicates more risk than the market while a beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility.

Inadequate risk management, though, can result in severe consequences for companies, individuals, and the economy. The subprime mortgage meltdown that led to the Great Recession stemmed from bad risk management.""""""","This article discusses the concept of risk management in finance and why it is crucial for investment decisions.

What Is the Stock Market? What Does It Do and How Does It Work? Investing Stocks Bonds ETFs Options and Derivatives Commodities Trading FinTech and Automated Investing Brokers Fundamental Analysis Technical Analysis Markets View All. 

Understanding the Stock Market 

The term stock market refers to several exchanges in which shares of publicly held companies are bought and sold. Such financial activities are conducted through formal exchanges and via over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces that operate under a defined set of regulations. Both stock market and stock exchange are often used interchangeably. Traders in the stock market buy or sell shares on one or more of the stock exchanges that are part of the overall stock market. The leading U.S. stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.

Stock markets are venues where buyers and sellers meet to exchange equity shares of public corporations. Stock markets are components of a free-market economy because they enable democratized access to investor trading and exchange of capital. Stock markets create efficient price discovery and efficient dealing.

The stock market allows buyers and sellers of securities to meet, interact, and transact. The markets allow for price discovery for shares of corporations and serve as a barometer for the overall economy.

How the Stock Market Works 

Stock markets provide a secure and regulated environment where market participants can transact in shares and other eligible financial instruments with confidence with zero to low operational risk. Operating under the defined rules as stated by the regulator, the stock markets act as primary markets and secondary markets.

As a primary market, the stock market allows companies to issue and sell their shares to the public for the first time through the process of an initial public offering (IPO). This activity helps companies raise necessary capital from investors. A company divides itself into several shares and sells some of those shares to the public at a price per share.

What Are the Functions of a Stock Market

The stock market ensures price transparency, liquidity, price discovery, and fair dealings in trading activities. The stock market guarantees all interested market participants have access to data for all buy and sell orders, thereby helping in the fair and transparent pricing of securities. The market also ensures efficient matching of appropriate buy and sell orders.

How Stock Markets Are Regulated 

Most nations have a stock market and each is regulated by a local financial regulator or monetary authority or institute. The SEC is the regulatory body charged with overseeing the U.S. stock market. The SEC is a federal agency that works independently of the government and without political pressure. 

Companies listed on the stock market exchanges are regulated and their dealings are monitored by the SEC. In addition, the exchanges set certain requirements such as mandating timely filing of quarterly financial reports and instant reporting of relevant corporate developments to ensure that all market participants are equally informed.

What Is the Significance of the Stock Market

The stock market is a component of a free-market economy. It allows companies to raise money by offering stock shares and corporate bonds and allows investors to participate in the financial achievements of the companies, make profit through capital gains, and earn income through dividends.

Who Helps an Investor Trade on the Stock Market

Stockbrokers act as intermediaries between the stock exchanges and the investors by buying and selling stocks and portfolio managers are professionals who invest portfolios or collections of securities for clients. Investment bankers represent companies in various capacities such as private companies that want to go public via an IPO or companies that are involved in pending mergers and acquisitions.

30,30,30,"""A grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT) is a special type of irrevocable trust that allows the trustmaker, or grantor, to gamble against the odds. If the trustmaker plays his cards right, a significant amount of wealth can move down to the next generation with virtually no estate or gift tax ramifications. The trustmaker transfers specific assets into the name of the GRAT and retains the right to receive an annual annuity payment for a certain number of years. 

When the term of the GRAT ends, what is left in the GRAT is distributed to the trust beneficiaries. The amount of the annuity payment required to be paid to the trustmaker during the term of the GRAT is calculated using an interest rate the IRS determines monthly—called the section 7520 rate. The transfer of assets owned by someone into an irrevocable trust for the benefit of someone else would ordinarily be deemed a gift for federal gift tax purposes, but with a GRAT, if theoretically all of the assets transferred in could come back to the trustmaker, the value of the gift to the beneficiaries of the GRAT will be at or close to 0. 

The trustmaker is really betting on the fact that the assets transferred into the GRAT will appreciate above and beyond the section 7520 interest rate and increase the value of assets. However, the downsides are that the trustmaker could die during the term of the GRAT, or assets could grow below the section 7520 rate. 

Since changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, GRATs have remained the same. They are not for everyone and they do not work for every type of asset. They are also frowned upon as an estate reduction tool by some policy makers.""","This article discusses a financial instrument called a grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT), which is a specialized type of irrevocable trust. The trustmaker transfers assets into the GRAT with the aim to move wealth to the next generation, minimizing estate or gift tax implications.

However, risks include the trustmaker's possible death during the trust term or the asset value growth falling below the 7520 rate. Despite modifications in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, GRATs have remained unchanged but are not suitable for everyone or all asset types.

What Are Futures Futures are derivative financial contracts that obligate parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date and price. The buyer must purchase or the seller must sell the underlying asset at the set price regardless of the current market price at the expiration date. Underlying assets include physical commodities and financial instruments. Futures contracts detail the quantity of the underlying asset and are standardized to facilitate trading on a futures exchange. Futures can be used for hedging or trade speculation. Key Takeaways Futures are derivative financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset or the seller to sell an asset at a predetermined future date and set price. A futures contract allows an investor to speculate on the price of a financial instrument or commodity. Futures are used to hedge the price movement of an underlying asset to help prevent losses from unfavorable price changes. When you engage in hedging, you take a position opposite to the one you hold with the underlying asset if you lose money on the underlying asset the money you make on the futures contract can mitigate that loss. Futures contracts trade on a futures exchange and a contracts price settles after the end of every trading session. Understanding Futures Futures also called futures contracts allow traders to lock in the price of the underlying asset or commodity. These contracts have expiration dates and set prices that are known upfront. Futures are identified by their expiration month. For example, a December gold futures contract expires in December. Traders and investors use the term futures in reference to the overall asset class. However, there are many types of futures contracts available for trading including Commodity futures with underlying commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, corn, and wheat Stock index futures with underlying assets such as the SP 500 Index Currency futures including those for the euro and the British pound Precious metal futures for gold and silver U.S. Treasury futures for bonds and other financial securities It's important to note the distinction between options and futures. American-style options contracts give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset anytime before the expiration date of the contract. With European options, you can only exercise at expiration, but do not have to exercise that right. The buyer of a futures contract on the other hand is obligated to take possession of the underlying commodity or the financial equivalent at the time of expiration and not anytime before. The buyer of a futures contract can sell their position at any time before expiration and be free of their obligation. In this way, buyers of both options and futures contracts benefit from a leverage holder's position closing before the expiration date. Pros Investors can use futures contracts to speculate on the direction of the price of an underlying asset. Companies can hedge the price of their raw materials or products they sell to protect against adverse price movements. Futures contracts may only require a deposit of a fraction of the contract amount with a broker. Cons Investors risk losing more than the initial margin amount since futures use leverage. Investing in a futures contract might cause a company that hedged to miss out on favorable price movements. Margin can be a double-edged sword, meaning gains are amplified but so too are losses. Using Futures The futures markets typically use high leverage. Leverage means that the trader does not need to put up 100% of the contracts value amount when entering into a trade. Instead, the broker would require an initial margin amount, which consists of a fraction of the total contract value. The amount required by the broker for a margin account can vary depending on the size of the futures contract, the creditworthiness of the investor, and the broker's terms and conditions. The exchange where the futures contract trades will determine if the contract is for physical delivery or if it can be cash-settled. A corporation may enter into a physical delivery contract to lock in the price of a commodity it needs for production. However, many futures contracts involve traders who speculate on the trade. These contracts are closed out or netted the difference in the original trade and closing trade price and have a cash settlement. Futures for Speculation A futures contract allows a trader to speculate on the direction of a commodity's price. If a trader bought a futures contract and the price of the commodity rose and was trading above the original contract price at expiration, then they would have a profit. Before expiration, the futures contract the long position would be sold at the current price, closing the long position. The difference between the prices would be cash-settled in the investor's brokerage account and no physical product would change hands. However, the trader could also lose if the commodity's price was lower than the purchase price specified in the futures contract. Speculators can also take a short speculative position if they predict the price of the underlying asset will fall. If the price does decline, the trader will take an offsetting position to close the contract. Again, the net difference would be settled at the expiration of the contract. An investor would realize a gain if the underlying asset's price was below the contract price and a loss if the current price was above the contract price. It's important to note that trading on margin allows for a much larger position than the amount held by the brokerage account. As a result, margin investing can amplify gains but it can also magnify losses. Imagine a trader who has a $5000 brokerage account balance and has a $50000 position in crude oil. If the price of oil moves against the trade, it can mean losses that far exceed the account's $5000 initial margin amount. In this case, the broker would make a margin call requiring that additional funds be deposited to cover the market losses. Futures for Hedging Futures can be used to hedge the price movement of the underlying asset. Here, the goal is to prevent losses from potentially unfavorable price changes rather than to speculate. Many companies that enter hedges are using or in many cases producing the underlying asset. For example, corn farmers can use futures to lock in a specific price for selling their corn crop. By doing so, they reduce their risk and guarantee they will receive the fixed price. If the price of corn decreased, the farmer would have a gain on the hedge to offset losses from selling the corn at the market. With such a gain and loss offsetting each other, the hedging effectively locks in an acceptable market price. Regulation of Futures The futures markets are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC is a federal agency created by Congress in 1974 to ensure the integrity of futures market pricing, including preventing abusive trading practices, fraud, and regulating brokerage firms engaged in futures trading. Example of Futures Let's say a trader wants to speculate on the price of crude oil by entering into a futures contract in May with the expectation that the price will be higher by year-end. The December crude oil futures contract is trading at $50 and the trader buys the contract. Since oil is traded in increments of 1000 barrels, the investor now has a position worth $50000 of crude oil (1000 x 50=50000). However, the trader will only need to pay a fraction of that amount upfront the initial margin that they deposit with the broker. From May to December the price of oil fluctuates as does the value of the futures contract. If oil's price gets too volatile the broker may need to ask that additional funds to be deposited into the margin account. This is called maintenance margin. In December, the end date of the contract is approaching the third Friday of the month. The price of crude oil has risen to $65. The trader sells the original contract to exit the position. The net difference is cash-settled. The yearn $15000 less any fees and commissions owed the broker (65-50=15 x 1000=$15000). However, if the price oil had fallen to $40 instead, the investor would have lost $10000 (50-40 a loss of 10 x 1000 a loss of $10000). What Are Futures Contracts Futures contracts are an investment vehicle that allows the buyer to bet on the future price of a commodity or other security. There are many types of futures contracts available. These may have underlying assets such as oil, stock market indices, currencies, and agricultural products. Unlike forward contracts, which are customized between the parties involved, futures contracts trade on organized exchanges such as those operated by the CME Group Inc. (CME). Futures contracts are popular among traders who aim to profit on price swings as well as commercial customers who wish to hedge their risks. Are Futures a Type of Derivative Yes, futures contracts are a type of derivative product. They are derivatives because their value is based on the value of an underlying asset, such as oil in the case of crude oil futures. Like many derivatives, futures are a leveraged financial instrument offering the potential for outsized gains or losses. As such, they are generally considered to be an advanced trading instrument and are usually traded only by experienced investors and institutions. What Happens if You Hold a Futures Contract Until Expiration Often times, traders who hold futures contracts until expiration will settle their position in cash. In other words, the trader will simply pay or receive a cash settlement depending on whether the underlying asset increased or decreased during the investment holding period. In some cases, however, futures contracts will require physical delivery. In this scenario, the investor holding the contract upon expiration would take delivery of the underlying asset. They'd be responsible for the goods and covering costs for material handling, physical storage, and insurance.

They allow traders to lock in the price of the underlying asset or commodity, and can be used for hedging or trade speculation. Futures contracts, traded on a futures exchange, are standardized and detail the quantity of the underlying asset. They have expiration dates and set prices known upfront. It's important to understand the difference between options and futures as the buyer of a futures contract is obligated to take possession of the underlying commodity or its financial equivalent at the time of expiration. Futures markets use high leverage, requiring only a margin of the total contract value when entering a trade. They can be used for speculation or hedging the price movement of the underlying asset.

But there is no physical exchange of money from one party to another. In the world of electronic markets traders usually take a position in a specific currency with the hope that there will be some upward movement and strength in the currency they're buying or weakness if they're selling so that they can make a profit. A currency is always traded relative to another currency. If you sell a currency you are buying another and if you buy a currency you are selling another. The profit is made on the difference between your transaction prices. Example of Forex Transactions Assume a trader believes that the EUR will appreciate against the USD. Another way of thinking of it is that the USD will fall relative to the EUR. The trader buys the EURUSD at 1.2500 and purchases 5000 worth of currency. Later that day the price has increased to 1.2550. The trader is up 25. If the price dropped to 1.2430 the trader would be losing 35. Most brokers provide leverage. Many U.S. brokers leverage up to 1 to 50. Let's assume our trader uses 10 to 1 leverage on this transaction. If using 10 to 1 leverage the trader is not required to have 5000 in an account even while trading 5000 worth of currency. Only 500 is needed. In this example a profit of 25 can be made quite quickly considering the trader only needs 500 or 250 of trading capital or even less if using more leverage. That shows the power of leverage. The flip side is that the trader could lose the capital just as quickly.Forex trading can be risky and complex involving quick decisions due to how fast exchange rates change. It is likely not suited for beginner traders however traders can spend time learning forex trading with test trading or with low levels of capital. How Much Do You Need to Start Trading Forex You can start trading Forex with around 100. This will be enough to get you started in buying and selling currencies. It is also a good level for beginners as it is not a very large amount of capital to lose. What Are the Risks of Forex Trading There are many risks to forex trading. Exchange rates are very volatile changing often which could quickly impact a trade. There is also a significant amount of leverage involved in FX meaning small movements can result in large losses. In addition there is transaction risk interest rate risk and country risk. The Bottom Line Forex is foreign exchange which refers to the global trading of currencies and currency derivatives. It is the largest financial market in the world involving the buying and selling of currencies in pairs taking advantage of changing rates.""""""
","The article examines foreign exchange, known as ""Forex,"" outlining what it is, its purpose, how it works, and the risks involved. Forex is a global electronic marketplace for trading international currencies and currency derivatives. These trades can be made for business transactions stemming from financial institutions and organizations, or for speculation on currency values. Currencies on Forex are traded in pairs, and profitability arises when traders can successfully predict and capitalize on changes in currency values. Trading volume on Forex is colossal, surpassing $5 trillion per day. Risks involved in Forex include the volatility of exchange rates, leverage, transaction risk, interest rate risk, and country risk. The piece underscores the need for quick decision-making in response to rapid exchange rate changes, which can magnify the impact of these risks. Despite the risks, individuals with as little as $100 can start trading on Forex, although a prudent approach is recommended for beginners.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp
33,33,33,"""What Is Diversification Definition as Investing Strategy. Diversification is a risk management strategy that creates a mix of various investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt to limit exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security. 

Diversification is a strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio in an attempt to reduce portfolio risk. Diversification is most often done by investing in different asset classes such as stocks bonds, real estate, or cryptocurrency. Diversification can also be achieved by purchasing investments in different countries, industries, sizes of companies, or term lengths for income-generating investments. 

Studies and mathematical models have shown that maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of 25 to 30 stocks yields the most cost-effective level of risk reduction. Investing in more securities generates further diversification benefits but it does so at a substantially diminishing rate of effectiveness. Diversification strives to smooth out unsystematic risk events in a portfolio so the positive performance of some investments neutralizes the negative performance of others. 

The benefits of diversification hold only if the securities in the portfolio are not perfectly correlated, that is they respond differently, often in opposing ways, to market influences. As investors consider ways to diversify their holdings, there are dozens of strategies to implement. Many of the methods below can be combined to enhance the level of diversification within a single portfolio.

Diversification is a very important concept in financial planning and investment management. It is the idea that by investing in different things, the overall risk of your portfolio is lower. Instead of putting all your money into a single asset, spreading your wealth across different assets puts you at less risk of losing capital. With the ease of transacting and investing online, it is now incredibly easy to diversify your portfolio through different asset classes and other strategies.""","The article discusses the principle of diversification as an investment strategy.

Investors ordinarily aim to balance risks and rewards based on financial goals, risk tolerance, and the investment horizon. Key TakeawaysAsset allocation is how investors split up their portfolios among different kinds of assets. The three main asset classes are equities, fixed income, and cash and cash equivalents. Each asset class has different risks and return potential so each will behave differently over time. There's no formula for the right asset allocation for everyone but the consensus among most financial professionals is that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions investors make. Investors use different asset allocations for distinct goals. Risk tolerance plays a key factor as well. Age-Based Asset AllocationFinancial advisors generally recommend holding stocks for five years or longer. Financial advisors once recommended subtracting an investor's age from 100 to determine what percentage should be invested in stocks. Portfolios should generally move to a more conservative asset allocation to help lower risk as individuals approach retirement. Asset Allocation Through Life-Cycle FundsSome asset-allocation mutual funds are known as life-cycle or target-date funds. Critics of this approach point out that a standardized solution for allocating portfolio assets is wrongheaded because individual investors require individual solutions. These funds gradually reduce the risk in their portfolios as they near the target date. HowDoEconomicChangesAffectAssetAllocationStrategiesEconomic cycles of growth and contraction greatly affect how you should allocate your assets. During bull markets, investors ordinarily prefer growth-oriented assets like stocks to profit from better market conditions. Alternatively, during downturns or recessions, investors tend to shift toward more conservative investments like bonds or cash equivalents which can help preserve capital.WhatIsanAssetAllocationFundAn asset allocation fund provides investors with a diversified portfolio of investments across various asset classes. The asset allocation of the fund can be fixed or variable among a mix of asset classes. WhatIsaGoodAssetAllocationWhat works for one person might not work for another. There is no such thing as a perfect asset allocation model. A good asset allocation varies by individual and can depend on various factors including age, financial targets, and appetite for risk. WhatIstheBestAssetAllocationStrategyforMyAgeGenerally, the younger and further you are from needing to access the capital invested, the more you should invest in stocks. HowDoesBehavioralFinanceViewAssetAllocationBehavioral finance explores how common cognitive errors might influence our financial choices. For our asset allocation, we might be swayed too much by recent market trends or loss aversion which can lead to less beneficial allocation choices. TheBottomLineMost financial professionals will tell you that asset allocation is one of the most important decisions investors can make. The selection of individual securities is secondary to how assets are allocated in stocks, bonds, and cash and cash equivalents which will play more of a role in your investment results.ArticleSourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

The three main asset classes discussed are equities, fixed income and cash, each having distinct risk-return characteristics.

What is Behavioral Finance? Behavioral finance is the study of the influence of psychology on the behavior of investors or financial analysts. It also includes the subsequent effect on the markets. It focuses on the fact that investors are not always rational, have limits to their self-control, and are influenced by their own biases. Traditional Financial Theory In order to better understand behavioral finance, let's first look at traditional financial theory. Traditional finance includes the following beliefs: Both the market and investors are perfectly rational Investors truly care about utilitarian characteristics Investors have perfect self-control They are not confused by cognitive errors or information processing errors.

Behavioral Finance Theory Now let's compare traditional financial theory with behavioral finance. Traits of behavioral finance are: Investors are treated as normal, not rational They actually have limits to their self-control Investors are influenced by their own biases Investors make cognitive errors that can lead to wrong decisions.

Decision-Making Errors and Biases Let's explore some of the buckets or building blocks that make up behavioral finance. Behavioral finance views investors as normal but being subject to decision-making biases and errors. 

Self-Deception The concept of self-deception is a limit to the way we learn. When we mistakenly think we know more than we actually do, we tend to miss information that we need to make an informed decision.

Heuristic Simplification This refers to information-processing errors.

Emotion in Behavioral Finance refers to our making decisions based on our current emotional state. Our current mood may take our decision-making off track from rational thinking.

Social Influence shows how our decision-making is influenced by others.

The Top 10 Biases in Behavioral Finance are: Overconfidence and illusion of control Self Attribution Bias Hindsight Bias Confirmation Bias The Narrative Fallacy Representative Bias Framing Bias Anchoring Bias Loss Aversion Herding Mentality Overcoming Behavioral Finance Issues There are ways to overcome negative behavioral tendencies in relation to investing.

Strategies to guard against biases:

Focus on the Process There are two approaches to decision-making: Reflexive, going with your gut, which is effortless, automatic and is our default option. Reflective, logical and methodical, but requires effort to engage in actively. Relying on reflexive decision-making makes us more prone to deceptive biases and emotional and social influences. Establishing logical decision-making processes can help protect you from such errors.

Prepare Plan and Pre-Commit Behavioral finance teaches us to invest by preparing, by planning, and by making sure we pre-commit.

Warren Buffett once said, 'Investing success doesn't correlate with IQ after you're above a score of 25. Once you have ordinary intelligence, then what you need is the temperament to control urges that get others into trouble.'

Behavioral finance, on the other hand, acknowledges that investors are not always rational, have self-control limitations, and are guided by their biases, leading them to make cognitive errors that can result in wrong decisions. Biases, such as overconfidence, self-attribution, and hindsight bias, may interfere with decision-making, although strategies such as focusing on a logical and methodical process and pre-committing can help guard against such errors.

38,38,38,"""Prospect Theory: A psychology theory that states that people make decisions based on perceived losses or gains. This theory describes how people make decisions when presented with alternatives that involve risk, probability, and uncertainty. Most people would choose to retain the wealth that they already have rather than risk the chance to increase their current wealth. 

The prospect theory, sometimes referred to as the loss-aversion theory, was introduced by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in the paper 'Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk' that was published in the Econometrica journal in 1979. This theory is used to evaluate various aspects of political decision-making in international relations. 

The decision-making process as per the theory is described in two phases: the editing phase and the evaluation phase. The editing phase refers to the characterization of options for choice or framing effects, which explain how a person's choice is influenced by the wording, order or method in which the choices are presented. The evaluation phase involves decision based on potential outcomes and choosing the option with a higher utility.

The characteristics of Prospect Theory involves certainty, small probabilities, relative positioning and loss aversion. Critics however argue that it lacks psychological explanations for the process it talks about. Factors such as human emotional and affective responses that are important in the decision-making process are absent in the model. It also attracts criticism for inadequate framing theory that explains why actors generate the frames they use.""","The article discusses Prospect Theory, a psychological theory proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979 that asserts people make decisions based on the fear of potential losses or the potential for gains. This theory especially examines decision-making under situations involving risk, uncertainty, and probability, with most people preferring to keep their existing wealth rather than take a risk to increase it. The theory involves a two-phase decision-making process: the editing phase, related to framing options for choice, and the evaluation phase, concerning decision-making based on potential outcomes. Key characteristics of the theory include certainty, small probabilities, relative positioning, and loss aversion. Despite its significance, critics argue that the theory lacks a psychological explanation for the processes it describes and fails to factor in emotional responses and considerations in the decision-making process. They also criticize it for an inadequate framing theory.

Trading FinTech and Automated Investing Brokers Fundamental Analysis Technical Analysis Markets. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is legislation that was passed by the U.S. Congress in response to financial industry behavior that led to the financial crisis of 2007-2008. It sought to make the U.S. financial system safer for consumers and taxpayers. The Dodd-Frank Act targeted financial system sectors that were believed to have caused the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The institutions considered responsible for the 2007-2008 financial crisis included banks, insurance companies, investment banking firms, mortgage lenders, and credit rating agencies. Critics of the law argue that the regulatory burdens it imposes could make U.S. firms less competitive than their foreign counterparts. In 2018, Congress passed a new law that rolled back some of Dodd-Frank's restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is a massive piece of financial reform legislation that was passed in 2010 during the Obama administration. It established a number of new government agencies tasked with overseeing the various components of the law and by extension various aspects of the financial system. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was intended to prevent another financial crisis like the one in 2007-2008. Financial Stability Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Orderly Liquidation Authority monitor the financial stability of major financial firms. The law also provides for liquidations or restructurings via the Orderly Liquidation Fund. The council has the authority to break up banks that are considered so large as to pose systemic risk. It can also force banks to increase their reserve requirements. Similarly, the new Federal Insurance Office was tasked with identifying and monitoring insurance companies that were also considered too big to fail. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was given the job of preventing predatory mortgage lending and helping consumers understand the terms of a mortgage before agreeing to it. The Volcker Rule restricts how banks can invest, limits speculative trading, and eliminates proprietary trading. Banks are not allowed to be involved with hedge funds or private equity firms, which are considered too risky. Dodd-Frank established the SEC Office of Credit Ratings because credit rating agencies had been accused of giving out misleading favorable investment ratings in the lead-up to the financial crisis. Detractors of the Dodd-Frank Act have argued that the law could harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms relative to their foreign counterparts. They contend that its regulatory compliance requirements unduly burden community banks and smaller financial institutions despite the fact that they played no role in causing the financial crisis. In 2018, the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act rolled back numerous regulations put in place by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act enacted in 2010 was a direct response to the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the ensuing government bailouts under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). This law established a wide range of reforms throughout the entire financial system with the purpose of preventing a repeat of the 2007-2008 crisis and the need for further government bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act also included additional protections for consumers.""","The article provides an overview of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a significant piece of financial reform legislation passed by the U.S. Congress in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The Act aimed to safeguard the U.S. financial system and taxpayers by targeting institutions deemed responsible for the crisis, including banks, insurance companies, investment banking firms, mortgage lenders, and credit rating agencies. It introduced new regulatory bodies, imposed restrictions on certain financial activities, and provided provisions for liquidations or restructurings of major financial firms. It also established consumer protection measures against predatory mortgage lending. However, critics of the Act argue that it might reduce the competitiveness of U.S firms internationally and burdens smaller financial establishments with compliance requirements, despite their lack of involvement in the crisis. In response to these concerns, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 rolled back some of the Dodd-Frank Act's restrictions.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp

SolvencyII sets out requirements applicable to insurance and reinsurance companies in the EU with the aim to ensure the adequate protection of policyholders and beneficiaries. SolvencyII has a risk-based approach that enables to assess the overall solvency of insurance and reinsurance undertakings through quantitative and qualitative measures. The SolvencyII regulatory framework is built on a three-pillar structure. Pillar I sets the quantitative requirements i.e the assets and liabilities valuation and capital requirements. Pillar II sets the qualitative requirements including governance and risk management of the undertakings and the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ORSA. Pillar III sets the supervisory reporting and public disclosure. The three pillars form a coherent approach that allows to understand and to manage risks across the sector. The key features of the SolvencyII regulatory framework are: Market consistent assets and liabilities shall be valued at the amount for which they can be exchanged, transferred or settled in the market. Risk-based Higher risks will lead to a higher capital requirement to cover for unexpected losses. Proportionate regulatory requirements shall be applied in a manner that is proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent to the business of the insurance and reinsurance undertakings.
The SolvencyII legislation is implemented on three levels. Level 1 Solvency II Directive. Level 2 the Delegated Regulation and Implementing technical standards. Level 3 Guidelines. Opinions, decisions and protocols are issued to increase the convergence of supervisory practices. SolvencyII came to life as three generations of EU Directives since the 1970s paved the way for an insurance market to operate on the basis of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services within the European Union. The crisis in 2008 showed the importance of a harmonised understanding of the risks by all involved actors and the need for considering wider implications for financial stability. It crystallised the need for bringing the regulatory framework at the forefront of modern risk management reflecting the reality of large groups operating on a cross-border basis.""""""","SolvencyII is a prudential regime implemented by the EU in January 2016 to regulate insurance and reinsurance undertakings.

The new version does the same but swaps in crypto to reflect the ecosystem's spread. Last week Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal titled 'Blockchain Is Much More Than Crypto' in which he reminded us of the potentially far-reaching impact of tokenization and peer-to-peer payments and drilled down on the benefits of risk reduction and settlement speed. Last month Citi published the results of a survey showing that 92% of participating institutions see value in tokenization while 88% are either exploring distributed ledger use cases or actively participating in blockchain projects. The Red Cross talked about ongoing work on a blockchain-based aid distribution prototype and Japanese banking conglomerate Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group announced plans to work on 'soulbound' tokens for digital identity. Blockchain not bitcoin emerged in 2018 as an attempt by enterprise projects to capitalize on the market's performance woes, the new version does the same but swaps in crypto to reflect the ecosystem's spread. A large part of this is a cyclical narrative shift. Both hype and failure are a natural part of a new technology's evolution. The last wave of blockchain hype may not seem to have produced much value. Pilots and proofs of concept involving lettuce, plastics, even alarmingly nuclear weapons seemed to deliver no practical utility. Groups working on blockchain use cases for trade finance, healthcare, telecoms, insurance, and more have either gone quiet or been wound down. We have seen some recent high-profile distributed ledger failures. IBM and Maersk announced the closure of their blockchain-based supply chain joint venture TradeLens. The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) canceled its much-hyped blockchain project after years of delays and cost overruns. This summer, blockchain-based trade finance initiative we.trade, backed by IBM and 12 major European banks went into liquidation and B3i, a blockchain insurance venture backed by more than 20 insurers and reinsurers ceased operation. Despite this, both hype and failure are a natural part of a new technology's evolution. Things that move fast get more attention. Enterprise experimentation does not move fast. Recent initiatives seem to have learned from the failures to date: start small, iterate up the ladder, and never overlook human incentives. For those who care about distributed ledger utility, there's plenty to get excited about. For those who think there's greater societal value in trading and saving, markets will continue to evolve and some prices will even eventually recover. Blockchain and crypto, there's plenty of room for both.""
","The article, ""Blockchain vs. Crypto: Not What It Seems,"" discusses the potential of blockchain technology beyond its applications in cryptocurrency. In 2018, enterprises aimed to leverage blockchain in response to volatile crypto market conditions. Goldman Sachs CEO, David Solomon, emphasizes the significant potential of the technology in various sectors due to tokenization, peer-to-peer payment systems, risk reduction, and settlement speed. A survey by Citi outlines that 92% of participating institutions find value in tokenization, and 88% are either investigating use cases or actively participating in blockchain projects. However, some past blockchain initiatives have failed or gone quiet, such as IBM and Maersk's supply chain project, the Australian Stock Exchange's project, and the we.trade finance initiative. Despite these setbacks, the writer maintains that such failures are part of the maturation process of a new technology. They encourage starting small, learning from past mistakes, and considering human incentives.

Cryptocurrency is a secure digital or virtual currency, which makes it almost impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. They function on a decentralized system underpinned by cryptographic systems and often facilitated by blockchain technology. Different cryptocurrencies serve various purposes, for instance, Ethereum's ether is mainly used as payment for transactions, while Ripple's XRP facilitates transfers between different geographical areas. The legal status of cryptocurrencies is ambiguous in many jurisdictions, as they don't have a backing from government or monetary entities. On the safety side, while the underlying technology is secure, investment in cryptocurrencies is considered risky due to scams, hacks, bugs, and volatility. Cryptocurrencies have been a tool to reform financial infrastructure, promising to make transactions faster and cheaper. Major cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Solana, and Cardano. Before investing in cryptocurrencies, it's important to understand their speculative nature and associated risks.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp
52,52,52,"""""""Blockchain 101 - The Ultimate Guide for Beginners
Blockchain is a decentralized record-keeping technology that stores data unalterably on a public ledger. It is decentralized, censorship-proof, immutable, and tamper-proof, making blockchain a secure technology. In a blockchain network, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT), every node works to prevent errors and verify transactions. Traditional databases store data in tables, rows, columns, and files, blockchain uses blocks that are chained together to store data. 

The first and most famous thing to represent the use of blockchain is Bitcoin. Blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer ledger that enables users to transact without any centralized authority. The consensus about the state of balances and transactions among network validators is reached via a consensus mechanism. Blockchain technology is not just related to cryptocurrencies. Judiciary banks, logistics companies, the entertainment industry, and many other sectors are focusing more on blockchain solutions. Smart contract capabilities, tokenization and immutability are major benefits that blockchain technology offers to companies.

Blockchain technology is essentially a decentralized data-storing digital ledger. When anyone wishes to make a transaction on the blockchain network, an entry in a blockchain block representing that transaction is created. The resulting block is sent to the node operators in the network. Node operators are computers that operate independently of each other around the world. Blockchain networks have certain algorithms to validate transactions and achieve consensus. 

The most commonly used algorithms are Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). PoW networks like Bitcoin rely on powerful computer hardware for transaction validation and new block production. Each block in the blockchain is created by connecting to the previous block. The transaction in each block is verified with an alphanumeric timestamp called a hash and a consensus is reached on the block. 

The entire operation of blockchain technology can be broken down into five crucial steps: A transaction is made and authenticated, the transaction sparks the creation of a new blockchain block, the block is sent to every network node, network validators review the transaction data and add the block to the blockchain once the data is verified, and the updated blockchain that includes the new block and all previous blocks is distributed across the network.

Cryptocurrencies were put forward as a project by a pseudonymous individual creator or group named Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Bitcoin network and the first block were launched in 2009. Litecoin, created by Charlie Lee in 2011, is the second cryptocurrency created using open-source codes, directly following Bitcoin's footsteps. 

The concept of smart contracts came to blockchain technology and in December 2017, cryptocurrencies reached a new peak. A smart contract can be used to connect with a DeFi dApp, make a swap, purchase an item in a blockchain game, and for any transaction to be performed on the blockchain. 

Non-Fungible Tokens are unique assets that reflect all assets in the digital or real world. In-game items, artwork, music, videos, tickets, deeds, promissory notes and more can be secured with NFT technology. 

Decentralized finance represents finance protocols built on blockchains. DeFi technology is used to trade cryptocurrencies, earn interest, lend and borrow cryptos, store assets and do other things that traditional finance enables decentralization.

Blockchain projects are built around three key features - scalability, decentralization, and security. Most projects have had to sacrifice one feature to make the other two stand out.""""""","This article, titled ""Blockchain 101 - The Ultimate Guide for Beginners"", provides an in-depth overview of the principles and applications of blockchain technology. Described as a decentralized, censorship-proof, immutable, and tamper-proof digital ledger, blockchain technology stores data differently from traditional databases, using interconnected blocks rather than tables or files. Bitcoin was the first notable utilization of this technology, although its applications have expanded beyond cryptocurrency into industries like banking, logistics, and entertainment.

54,54,54,"""""""What Is a Robo-Advisor? By Jake Frankenfield Updated October 12, 2023 Reviewed by Cierra Murry Full Bio Cierra Murry is an expert in banking, credit cards, investing, loans, mortgages, and real estate. She is a banking consultant, loan signing agent, and arbitrator with more than 15 years of experience in financial analysis, underwriting, loan documentation, loan review, banking compliance, and credit risk management. Fact checked by Suzanne Kvilhaug Full Bio Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker. 

A robo-advisor, also sometimes spelled as roboadvisor, is a digital platform that provides automated, algorithm-driven financial planning and investment services with little to no human supervision. A typical robo-advisor asks questions about your financial situation and future goals through an online survey. It then uses the data to offer advice and automatically invest for you. 

Key Takeaways:

Robo-advisors are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithmic investment services with minimal human supervision.

They often automate and optimize passive indexing strategies based on modern portfolio theory.

Robo-advisors are often inexpensive and require low opening balances, making them available to retail investors.

They are best suited for traditional investing and aren't the best options for more complex issues such as estate planning.

Robo-Advisors History and Investing Strategy:

The first robo-advisors, Betterment and Wealthfront, launched in 2008. 

Wealthfront began as a mutual fund company. It planned to assist the tech community, then realized that computer software could make investment advice more accessible. 

Betterment, on the other hand, began with the initial purpose of rebalancing assets within target-date funds (TDFs). It sought to help manage passive buy-and-hold investments through a simple online interface.

Today most robo-advisors use passive indexing strategies that are optimized using some variant of modern portfolio theory (MPT). 

Robo-Advisors and Regulation:

Robo-advisors hold the same legal status as human advisors. Accordingly, they must be registered with the SEC and are subject to the same securities laws and regulations as traditional broker-dealers.

Hiring a Robo-Advisor:

Robo advisors don’t all cost the same amount and offer all the same features. Each one may excel in particular areas so it’s important to do some research first.

Limitations of Robo-Advisors:

Many in the industry have doubts about the viability of digital advisors as a one-size-fits-all solution to wealth management. Given their current technological capabilities and minimal human presence, robo-advisors have been criticized for lacking empathy and sophistication.

Robo-advisors are good entry-level options if you have a small account and limited investment experience. You may find them lacking if you need services like estate planning, complicated tax management, trust fund administration, and retirement planning.

Automated services are also ill-equipped to deal with unexpected crises or extraordinary situations.

How Robo-Advisors Get Paid:

The primary way that most robo-advisors get paid is through a wrap fee based on assets under management (AUM). 

The Bottom Line:

Robo-advisors leverage advances in algorithmic trading and electronic markets to automate investment strategies for ordinary investors. Often based on modern portfolio theory, robo-advisors are able to optimize investors' risk-return trade-offs and automatically manage and rebalance their portfolios.""""""","The article, ""What Is a Robo-Advisor?"" by Jake Frankenfield, delves into the mechanisms of robo-advisors - digital platforms providing automated, algorithm-driven financial planning and investment services. Originated in 2008 with Betterment and Wealthfront, robo-advisors typically automate and optimize passive indexing strategies based on modern portfolio theory (MPT), requiring minimum human supervision. Notably, they are subjected to the same securities laws as traditional human advisors and need to be registered with the SEC. Affordable and requiring low opening balances, these platforms are ideal for entry-level investing. However, they have limitations for complex scenarios like estate planning, intricate tax management, or crisis management. Primarily profiting from wrap fees based on assets under management (AUM), robo-advisors utilize algorithmic trading and electric markets to automate investment strategies and manage risk-return trade-offs for investors.

What Is Online Banking? Online banking allows you to conduct financial transactions via the Internet. Online banking is also known as Internet banking or web banking. Online banking offers customers almost every service traditionally available through a local branch including deposits, transfers, and online bill payments. Virtually every banking institution has some form of online banking you can access through a computer or app. 
Key Takeaways: Online banking allows you to conduct financial transactions via the Internet. You aren't required to visit a bank branch in order to complete basic online banking transactions. You need a device, an Internet connection, and a bank card to register for online banking. 
Understanding Online Banking: With online banking, you aren't required to visit a bank branch to complete most of your basic banking transactions. You can do all of this at your own convenience, wherever you want, at home, at work, or on the go. Online banking can be done using a browser or app. Mobile banking is online banking that is done on a phone or tablet. Using online banking requires a computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other device, plus an Internet connection and a bank or debit card. In order to access the service, you need to register for the bank's online banking service and create a password. Once that's done, you can use the service to do your banking. Banking transactions offered online vary by institution. Most banks generally offer basic services such as transfers and bill payments. Some banks also allow customers to open up new accounts and apply for credit cards through online banking portals. 
Other functions may include ordering checks, putting stop payments on checks, or reporting a change of address. Checks can be deposited online through a mobile app using remote deposit capture. Online banking typically does not permit the purchase of traveler's checks, bank drafts, or certain wire transfers. It also typically does not permit the completion of certain credit applications such as for mortgages. These transactions still need to take place face-to-face with a bank representative. 
Most banks do not charge fees for online banking. Online Banks: Online banks operate exclusively online with no physical branch at all. The best online banks offer low-cost or free banking, plus above-average yields on savings accounts and tools to help you manage your money. Online-only banks may not provide direct ATM access but will make provisions for customers to use ATMs at other banks and retail stores. They may reimburse you for some of the ATM fees charged by other financial institutions. Reduced overhead costs associated with not having physical branches typically allow online banks to offer significant savings on banking fees. They also offer higher interest rates on savings accounts. These banks handle customer service by phone, email, or online chat instead of in person. Prominent online banks in the United States include Ally Bank, Discover Bank, and Synchrony Bank. 
Advantages of Online Banking: Convenience is a major advantage of online banking. Basic banking transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds between accounts can easily be done anytime of the day or night, seven days a week. If your bank offers a payment network such as Zelle you can use your online bank account to send money to another person. Online banking is fast and efficient. Funds can be transferred between accounts almost instantly, especially if the two accounts are held at the same institution. You can open and close a number of different accounts online from fixed deposits to recurring deposit accounts that typically offer higher rates of interest. You can also monitor your accounts closely, allowing you to keep your accounts safe. Around-the-clock access to banking information provides early detection of fraudulent activity, thereby acting as a guardrail against financial damage or loss. 
Disadvantages of Online Banking: For a novice online banking customer, using electronic systems for the first time may present challenges that prevent transactions from being processed, which is why some people prefer face-to-face transactions with a teller. Online banking doesn't help if you need access to large amounts of cash. While you may be able to withdraw a certain amount at the automatic teller machine ATM, most cards come with a limit; you will have to visit a branch to get the rest. Although online banking security is continually improving, such accounts are still vulnerable when it comes to hacking. Customers are advised to use their own data plans rather than public wifi networks when using online banking to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, online banking is dependent on a reliable Internet connection. Connectivity issues from time to time may make it difficult to determine if banking transactions have been successfully processed.

People are using mobile payments these days to complete quick transactions through their mobile devices. The Concept of a Mobile Payment: A mobile payment entails a transaction made through a mobile device. The customer can use a smartphone, smartwatch or even a wristband. The user will pay for something with a mobile payment solution like Apple Pay or Google Pay. The system incorporates credit card or bank data in one platform. Each mobile payment comes from a digital wallet. The wallet will link to an appropriate interface or platform. The wallet will include the bank or card info. The mobile payment system takes the payment info from the digital wallet and uses it to cover the transaction. Customers don't have to get a physical credit card out to complete a transaction. A Safer Solution: Mobile transactions are safer. A mobile payment can help the customer send data from a digital wallet to the retailer completing the transaction without providing any cards. The mobile payment system ensures full security over a deal. Many mobile devices are also locked through PINs or other biometric features so that adds extra security to the deal. How People Get These Systems: People will apply for credit cards by filling out the proper forms for getting them ready. A mobile payment is different as a customer will require a suitable payment app on ones device. Since people don't need credit to get a mobile payment account, you can expect these payments to be more common. Convenience For the Customer: Customers also use mobile transactions because they are more convenient. It takes less time to complete a mobile payment than it does to run a credit card. Mobile payment platforms can inform customers of whatever coupons or other discounts they have stored with them. What Systems Accept These: A POS system must support a system like Google Pay or Apple Pay to complete mobile payments. Will Mobile Payments Take Over: It is possible that mobile payments will become more popular than credit cards after a while. It will take a long time before anyone can figure out what will happen. The problem with mobile payments is that many people are uncertain about how they work. They also might not have the mobile devices necessary to complete these payments. You can expect mobile payments to become more prominent especially as mobile devices become more accessible. Potential advances in payment technology will also help increase the chances for these payments to be popular and useful among people.

63,63,63,"""""""The Mobile Payments Revolution Is Happening Now. Is Your Business Ready? Mobile payments are fueling a lifestyle and eCommerce revolution — is your company ready? Every day, shoppers around the world are choosing to pay for their items with mobile devices in their hands instead of the cash and credit cards in their wallets. This is all thanks to improved technology, better connectivity, and superior all-around convenience. As such, local payments made via mobile devices are experiencing dramatic growth worldwide, with no signs of slowing. Chinese payment app AliPay has over a billion users. By 2024, the predicted mobile payment market size is estimated to reach 3 trillion. From 2020 to 2025, mobile payments use will continue to rise at 27% of CAGR. Over 13% of the global population will adopt a mobile wallet by 2024. Sustained growth means that mobile-based payments aren't just a fad or trend — they are a lifestyle and eCommerce revolution that merchants must harness to succeed. The Mobile and Digital Payments Revolution Is Happening Now. Is Your Business Ready?

Three Types of Mobile Payments Commonly Used by Global Consumers:

1. Mobile Point of Sale: Growing in popularity around the world, mobile point of sale replaces a fixed POS terminal with a phone or tablet and uses special hardware to allow for payment via credit or debit card.
2. Remote Mobile Payments: Whether it's on an app like Amazon or a website like Nike.com, you are conducting a remote mobile payment whenever you purchase something via your mobile device.
3. Mobile Proximity Payments: Similar to mobile point-of-sale, mobile proximity payments are any transactions that occur at a point of sale where shoppers use a mobile device to pay in place of credit cards or cash. These transactions are useful for stores to accept mobile payments.

Digital Wallets Are Replacing Traditional Ones: As more shoppers rely on their phones to make purchases, they are reaching into their wallets less often. With that trend comes the rise of digital wallets, a preferred local payment method for both remote mobile payments and mobile proximity payments. Also known as e-wallets, digital wallets securely store shoppers' payment details like credit card or bank information from the convenience of their smartphone. Some e-wallets can also be topped up via cash deposits at retail locations and kiosks, eliminating the need for a bank or credit card.

The Types of Mobile Payment Wallets: Just like regular wallets, mobile wallets come in all shapes and sizes, each boasting various features and reasons to use them. Today there are two types of digital wallets growing in popularity across the world: closed-loop wallets and open-loop wallets.

1. Closed-Loop Wallet: Anyone who uses their Starbucks app to purchase their morning coffee is using a closed-loop wallet. Offered by retailers to increase loyalty, offer discounts, and learn more about their shoppers, closed-loop wallets are a popular way to pay for items only at a particular store.
2. Open-Loop Wallet: This type of digital wallet works more like a traditional wallet by storing bank and credit information and allowing shoppers to use it wherever it's an accepted form of payment. GrabPay, Paytm and AliPay are all prevalent examples of digital wallet platforms.

Implementing Mobile Solutions for Payment Increases Conversion Rates: Although mobile payments are the most common method for transactions around the world, research indicates that checkout abandonment rates are twice as likely to occur from a mobile shopper than a desktop shopper, which is why it's critical you get mobile payments right. 

Merchants Must Adopt Mobile Payments or Be Left Behind: While it is likely that cash will not disappear completely for 25 years or more, our transition towards a cashless society has only been expedited with some countries now having only minimal cash usage. Physical card payments are likely to lose significant ground to mobile and digital payments over the next ten years. Shoppers no longer need to carry around a physical purse or wallet when their smartphone can unlock all their payment needs. By 2027, experts predict the digital payments market to increase in value to almost 13 trillion, and mobile payments are set to be a key part of this revolution.
